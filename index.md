summary: Minimal ActivityPub server for posting federated podcast comments

# Overview
Interested in supporting [cross-app comments](https://podnews.net/update/cross-app-comments) for podcasts?

## Podcasters
You don't need this project or any custom software to get started today!
 - Create an account for your podcast on any existing Fediverse server (Mastodon/Pleroma/Castopod/etc), or host your own.
 - For each new episode you publish, create a post for it and add the post url to the [podcast:socialInteract](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/proposal-docs/social/social.md#socialinteract-element) tag in your podcast's rss feed.

 For example:
```xml
<rss xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0" ...>
  ...
  <item>
     <title>Episode 70: An episode about nothing</title>
     ...
     <podcast:socialInteract platform="mastodon" protocol="activitypub" accountId="@yourpodcast">
       https://mastodon.social/@yourpodcast/123456123456123456
     </podcast:socialInteract>
  </item>
  ...
</rss>
```

## Podcast App Developers
The best way to give your existing users the ability to comment to these posts is to host a service that speaks [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/).

Assuming you have an existing user/profile system in your app, you need to:
 - Create and host an ActivityPub [Actor](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#Overview) for each of your users that wants to post a comment
 - Create and host an ActivityPub object of type [Note](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-note) for each comment generated by your app, using the [inReplyTo](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-inreplyto) attribute to reference the parent comment on the remote Fediverse server
 - Create and host an ActivityPub activity of type [Create](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-create) that points to the Note
 - Federate the Create activity over to the remote Fediverse server, via an http `POST` to the remote user's [inbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox)
 - Also federate out profile updates (Update Actor activities) and "likes" (Like Object activities) in a similar way

## What is Minipub?
Minipub is an open-source microservice provided by this project that you can host on your own server, or in your own [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) account, that does all of this for you.
